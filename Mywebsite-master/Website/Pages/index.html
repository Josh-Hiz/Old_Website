        <p>
            This entire website was created out of my shear curiosity and boerdom. I took the situation in the world today as an oppurtunity to better my skills as well learn in the proccess. Before this I was Java exclusive and still learning Java, but I decidied
            I really needed to branch out and I figured HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were perfect!, (along with mySQL, node.js, etc etc) and will putting some of my own Java projects here, they are not huge but I am proud of it. Besides the school managment
            system good god that was a challenge and for only 2 weeks in coding in Java seriously, I am really damn proud.
